<h1>Closing the Command Bar</h1>
<section markdown>
  When you choose a sandbox scenario from the command bar it will automatically close
  on its own. However, if you bring it up and then decide you want to close it you can
  do so by simply clicking outside the command bar itself or by hitting the `esc` key.
