You can build Playground into a production application with the `--build` flag.

#### Prerequisites
* `@angular/cli`
* `@angular/service-worker`

#### Configuration

Additionally, in order for Playground to use the `ServiceWorkerModule`, you'll need to create a
custom Playground module with the following contents:
</section>
<div markdown path="/content/how-to/service-worker-module.md"></div>
<section markdown>
When bootstrapping Playground, use your custom module instead to enable Service Workers.
</section>
<div markdown path="/content/how-to/service-worker-main.md"></div>
<section markdown>
Finally, make sure that you have a valid `ngsw-config.json` provided within your project's `src`.

<div markdown path="/content/how-to/ngsw-config.md"></div>

<h4>Build with a Service Worker</h4>
<p>
    Assuming Playground is <a routerLink="/docs/getting-started/angular-cli">configured correctly</a>,
    the following commands will build Playground with a service worker, navigate to the build output,
    and start serving content.

```
angular-playground --build
cd ./dist/
http-server

Any http server application will do. This guide uses <a href="https://github.com/indexzero/http-server">http-server</a>.

Navigate to `127.0.0.1:8080` and open the "Applications" tab in Chrome Developer Tools to see the
service worker in action.
