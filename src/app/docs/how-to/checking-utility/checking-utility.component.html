<h1>Running the Error Checking Utility</h1>
<section markdown>
Playground ships with a checking utility that will open all of your sandboxed scenarios and visit them on a
page-by-page basis, logging whether there are console errors on that page.

```
angular-playground --check-errors
```

This can be useful for integration with a build system to ensure that when components are updated with new dependencies
the scenarios are also updated with mocks.

For exmaple, take a component that has a new dependency on a service, `MyService`.

</section>
<div markdown path="/content/docs/check-errors/component.md"></div>
<section markdown>
Since `MyService` is run during the component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook, the service must be present
when the component is initialized. Otherwise, Angular will throw a runtime error.

This means that if the sandbox for this scenario is missing a mock for the `myService.doStuff` method,
the scenario will also error.

#### Build Output

By default, Playground will only log build output to the console. However, if
your build system allows for more granularity, you can specify a report format with `reportType`.

The Playground checking utility supports the ability to publish JSON reports for build systems. To do this,
you can use the `reportType` configuration parameter. For example, the following will publish a build to
the provided file in JSON format when running the checking utility:

```
angular-playground --check-errors --report-path ./report.json --report-type json
```

#### Configuration

There are additional configuration options that can be applied to `checkErrors`. You can read about them
in our <a routerLink="/docs/api/configuration">configuration documentation</a>.
