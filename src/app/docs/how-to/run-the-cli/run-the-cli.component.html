<h1>Run the Playground CLI</h1>
<div markdown>
  By default, the CLI will assume that its configuration file lives at the root of the project
  (where `package.json` is located) and is called `angular-playground.json`. If these conditions
  are met, you can run the CLI like so:

  ```
  angular-playground
  ```

  Otherwise, a configuration file must be specified:

  ```
  angular-playground ./src/playground-options.json 
  ```
</div>
<h4>Example Configuration File</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/api/cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  The `sourceRoot` value will be a path relative to the location of your **package.json**
  file for your project. This will be the directory that will be looked at (it will go down recursively from there)
  to find your **\*.sandbox.ts** files dynamically. It will also be the directory where the **sandboxes.ts**
  file will get written to.

  This means you will most likely want to add `sandboxes.ts` to your `.gitignore` file:

```
/src/sandboxes.ts
```

  You will also want to set up a script in your `package.json` file to handle running the
  cli command:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/api/cli2.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  From there you can call:

```
npm run playground
```

  This will build your `sandboxes.ts` file and will start a watch that will handle
  re-running the file build as you modify/add files with the `*.sandbox.ts` extension
  in your project.
