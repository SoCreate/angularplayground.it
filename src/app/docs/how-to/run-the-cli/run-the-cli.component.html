<h1>Run the Playground CLI</h1>
<div markdown>
  By default, the CLI will assume that its configuration file lives at the root of the project
  (where `package.json` is located) and is called `angular-playground.json`. If these conditions
  are met, you can run the CLI like so:

  ```
  angular-playground
  ```

  Otherwise, a configuration file must be specified:

  ```
  angular-playground --config ./src/playground-options.json 
  ```
</div>
<h4>Example Configuration File</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/api/cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  The `sourceRoot` value will be a path relative to the location of your **package.json**
  file for your project. This will be the directory that will be looked at (it will go down recursively from there)
  to find your **\*.sandbox.ts** files dynamically.

  You will want to set up a script in your `package.json` file to handle running the cli command:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/api/cli2.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  From there you can call:

  ```
  npm run playground
  ```

  This will compile the paths to your sandbox files in one place, allowing webpack to
  allocate them as dynamically imported chunks. It also configures a watch that
  runs the build process as you add/modify files with the `*.sandbox.ts` extension.
</p>
<h4>Cli Commands</h4>
<p markdown>
  Almost all of the configuration file options are also available as CLI commands. For more details,
  visit the <a routerLink="/docs/api/configuration">CLI API documentation</a>.

  ```
  angular-playground --src ./src/ --config ./angular-playground.json
  ```

  You can also add Playground as a build step to check your sandboxed components for errors
  with the `--check-errors` flag.

  ```
  angular-playground --check-errors
  ```
