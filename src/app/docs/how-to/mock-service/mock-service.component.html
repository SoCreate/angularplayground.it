<h1>Mocking a Service</h1>
<section markdown>
Playground supports mocking service dependencies of application components. Take the following `MyComponent` example
below that currently has a `LoadDataService` dependency (<i>service included below for brevity</i>).

With `LoadDataService` called during the component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook (`this.dataService.loadData`), the
service must be available when the component is initialized or Angular will throw a runtime error. The same occurs for
sandboxes missing mocked service dependencies.

An easy way to mock a service in a sandbox is to include a mock service class (`MockLoadDataService`) in your
`*.sandbox.ts` file that returns mock data in the format you expect it. Then use Angular's dependency injection to swap
out the `LoadDataService` with the `MockLoadDataService`.

When the sandboxed component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is
called, the `MockLoadDataService` `loadData()` method will now be called instead of the `LoadDataService` `loadData()`
method.
