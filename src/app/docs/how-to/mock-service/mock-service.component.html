<h1>Mocking a Service</h1>
<section markdown>
Playground supports mocking service dependencies of application components. Take the following `MyComponent` example
below that currently has a `LoadDataService` dependency (<i>service included below for brevity</i>).

With `LoadDataService` called during the component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook (`this.dataService.loadData`), the
service must be available when the component is initialized or Angular will throw a runtime error. The same occurs for
sandboxes missing mocked service dependencies.

An easy way to mock a service in a sandbox is to include a mock service class (`MockLoadDataService`) in your
`*.sandbox.ts` file that returns mock data in the format you expect it and use Angular's alternative class provider
syntax so your mock service class can provide for the service during the sanboxed component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook.
