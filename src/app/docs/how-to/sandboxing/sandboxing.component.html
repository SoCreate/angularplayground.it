<h1>Sandboxing Components</h1>
<p markdown>
  To create a sandbox with scenarios for components in your Angular application you need
  to use the `sandboxOf` function and export the call to that as the default for the file.
  This file needs to have the `.sandbox.ts` extension for it to be auto-discovered.

  So let's say you have a `NoticeComponent` in a file named `notice.component.ts`.
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/sandboxing/sandboxing-components.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  You can then create a sandbox file using the CLI with the following command:

  ```
  ng generate angular-playground:sandbox [path]/[component name]
  ```

  In our example, from the `/notice` directory (where the NoticeComponent lives), we would run:

  ```
  ng generate angular-playground:sandbox notice
  ```

  This generate command comes with the following config setting:

  * `--flat` (optional, defaults to false): indicate whether a new directory should be created to hold the generated sandbox file
</p>

  You can also create sandbox files manually.
  For our example, create a new file next to the existing component file named `notice.component.sandbox.ts` with the following content:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/sandboxing/sandboxing-components2.md"></div>
