Playground ships with a test runner that will open all of your sandboxed scenarios and visit them on a
page-by-page basis, logging whether there are console errors on that page.

```
angular-playground --check-errors
```

This can be useful for integration with a build system to ensure that when components are updated with new dependencies
the scenarios are also updated with mocks.

For exmaple, take a component that has a new dependency on a service, `MyService`.

<div markdown path="/content/docs/check-errors/component.md"></div>
<section markdown>
Since `MyService` is run during the component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook, the service must be present
when the component is initialized. Otherwise, Angular will throw a runtime error.

This means that if the sandbox for this scenario is missing a mock for the `myService.doStuff` method,
the scenario will also error.

#### Configuration

There are additional configuration options that can be applied to `checkErrors`. You can read about them
in our <a routerLink="/docs/api/configuration">API documentation</a>.
