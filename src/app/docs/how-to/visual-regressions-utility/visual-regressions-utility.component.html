<h1>Running the Visual Regression Utility</h1>
<section markdown>
Playground ships with a visual regression utility that will take a snapshot of all of your scenarios, and check each
one for differences against the existing snapshot of that page. On the very first run, it will simply take snapshots to
compare against in subsequent runs.

```
npx angular-playground --check-visual-regressions
```

This can be useful for integration with a build system to ensure that components do not have unexpected visual
regressions after changes are made.

The image snapshots are stored in a directory specified by `--snapshot-directory [dir]`
(src/\_\_images_snapshots__ by default). If there are differences found while testing, diff files will be generated
for each snapshot that does not match. These diff files are stored in a directory specified by
`--diff-directory [dir]` (src/\_\_diff_output__ by default).

There is also a config option to update the snapshots instead of testing them, `--update-snapshots`. This is useful
for when you make changes to a component's template so it intentionally looks different than the saved snapshot.
Similarly, the `--delete-snapshots` config option deletes snapshots that are matched by a given path. When using either
of these options, you can also set the `--path-to-sandboxes [dir]` option, which allows you to only update or delete
snapshots for the given directory, which should be in the format of a relative path from the `/src` directory. If the
path option is not set, all snapshots will be updated or deleted.

There are several other options to help you control visual regression testing. `--visual-regression-mock-date` allows
you to pass in a time in milliseconds from epoch to set in the browser while visual regression snapshots are being
taken. This is useful for components that render info relating to the current time and date. This setting defaults to
the current time. There is also the `visualRegressionIgnore` setting, which can only be set from the
`angular-playground.json` file. This setting allows you to provide a list of RegExps to match paths of sandboxes you
want to exclude from visual regression testing. The type of this list is
<code>Array&lt;{{ '{' }} re: string, flags: string }&gt;</code>. Pass in the regex pattern and flags as strings, just
as you would in the RegExp constructor.

The matcher that we use has many configuration options, so if you would like to set those, you can do so via the
`imageMatcherConfig` property in `angular-playground.json` (this is one of the few options that can only be set via
json file). The full list of options can be found
[here](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot#optional-configuration).

See below for examples of the `imageMatcherConfig` and `visualRegressionIgnore` options.
