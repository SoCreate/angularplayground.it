<h4>Switching Sandboxes From the Keyboard</h4>
<p>
  When cycling through component sandbox scenarios in the command bar you can move between them
  with the up and down arrow keys.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <code>up</code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; <em>or</em> &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <code>down</code>
</blockquote>
<section markdown>
  Once a scenario is selected, the next time you open the command bar, hitting the `up` arrow key will
  move you to the scenario right before the currently selected item.

  Likewise, hitting the `down` arrow key will move you to the scenario right after the currently selected item.
