<h1>Bootstrapping Angular Playground</h1>
<p>
  It is designed to use your existing app as a host for serving up an Angular Playground
  application, which is nothing more than an Angular entry module that can be
  bootstrapped.
</p>
<p>To bootstrap the playground, you can create an entry script with the following:</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/bootstrapping.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  You can use your existing `index.html` and whatever other build/serve scenario you
  have in place for you app, you just need to change your entry point to be this
  `main.playground.ts` file instead of your `main.ts` file, or you could do some other
  type of logic to run the `initializePlayground` and bootstrap the `PlaygroundModule` conditionally.

  The `initializePlayground` function takes in an element selector string. The element
  selector is used to find your existing app element in your `index.html` DOM and
  replace it with the element selector used by the Angular Playground `AppComponent`.
