<h1>Bootstrapping Playground</h1>
<p>
  Playground is designed to use your existing app as a host for
  serving up an Playground application, which is nothing more
  than an Angular entry module that can be bootstrapped.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Playground also comes with <a routerLink="/docs/getting-started/angular-cli">built-in support</a>
  for projects using the Angular CLI. Head over there if your app is using
  the Angular CLI.

<p>To bootstrap the playground, you can create an entry script with the following:</p>
<section markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/bootstrapping.md"></section>
<section markdown>
  You can use your existing `index.html` and whatever other build/serve scenario you
  have in place for you app, you just need to change your entry point to be this
  `main.playground.ts` file instead of your `main.ts` file, or you could do some other
  type of logic to run the `initializePlayground` and bootstrap the `PlaygroundModule` conditionally.

  The `initializePlayground` function takes in an element selector string. The element
  selector is used to find your existing app element in your `index.html` DOM and
  replace it with the element selector used by the Playground `AppComponent`.

  If you decide to set up a separate `index.html` file in your project for Playground
  you would still need to call `initializePlayground()`, you would just do so with no
  argument for the element selector. You can put a `ap-root` element in your
  `index.html` file.

<h5>Resolving the sandboxes.ts File</h5>
<section markdown>
  The `PlaygroundModule` will load the sandboxes.ts file that the CLI generates via a `require('sandboxes')` call.
  In order for that to work you need to support module resolution of that **sandboxes** path to the sandboxes.ts
  file.

  If you are using Webpack, this can be accomplished with a `resolve.alias`:

<section markdown>
  Finally, all you need to do from here is to serve your application in a manner in which
  your `initializePlayground` and bootstrap of the `PlaygroundModule` call will get run.
