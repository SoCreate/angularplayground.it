<h1>Introduction</h1>

  The component architecture of [Angular](https://angular.io) allows for modularity, which can be glorious!
  You can break down your application into smaller chunks, contain logic and data,
  and create re-usability. But working on those chunks in the scope of your application
  can become cumbersome.

  For example, being able to create a component that just focuses on rendering
  a shipment line item is great, but to see that component in action typically requires
  you to launch the full app, find a customer that has an order that has a shipment that
  has line items so that you can see your component rendered. Development of modular
  components would be much more efficient if you could work on those in isolation...

  ##### Welcome to the Angular Playground!

  Angular Playground is a drop in entry module that provides a UI development
  environment for building and maintaining Angular application components,
  directives and pipes in isolation. It is an entry point module designed to be dropped
  in and run within your existing application, and takes advantage of your build
  system to build your components, directives and pipes.

  You can bootstrap the PlaygroundModule the same way you bootstrap your AppModule.

  There is a CLI provided with Playground that handles watching your filesystem
  and building a reference file for files in your project written to sandbox components
  and directives. You write sandbox code and then run the CLI command to start your
  build and watch.

<blockquote>
  You can create a sandbox for a component and set up multiple scenarios for the dependencies
  it uses.

  Playground is a micro-app designed to dynamically render components, directives and
  pipes from your application. It is contained within the `PlaygroundModule` and comes ready
  to be bootstrapped. You actually set up your app and your build pipeline to launch an instance
  of your environment with the `PlaygroundModule` as the entry module. This allows Playground to be able to
  render your components, directives and pipes while making use of whatever custom stuff
  you do in your app.
</section>
<blockquote>
  You leverage your build pipeline and serve, Playground runs like an instance of your app.

  Setting up an alternative bootstrap should be pretty straight forward. If you are using
  the Angular CLI you can take advantage of the built in support in Playground
  for hooking into `ng serve`.
