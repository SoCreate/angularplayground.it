<h1>Use Your Angular Libraries in Playground</h1>
<section markdown>
  Playground supports sandboxing your Angular Libraries in addition to your main Angular app, so you can easily
  work with all the sandboxed components in your Angular project.

  Once you have Playground set up with your main app, you will need to update 2 files: the `tsconfig.json` that is
  used with Playground, as well as `angular-playground.json`.

  Let's say our project structure looks something like this:
  ```
  my-app
  ├── angular.json
  ├── angular-playground.json
  ├── package.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  ├── ...
  ├── projects
  │   ├── my-lib
  │   │   ├── src
  │   │   │   └── ...
  │   │   └── ...
  ├── src
  │   ├── tsconfig.app.json
  │   ├── main.ts
  │   ├── main.playground.ts
  │   └── ...
  ```

  First, you'll need to update `angular-playground.json` to include the source directory of your library.

  Then, you'll need to update the tsconfig file (by default, this will be `src/tsconfig.app.json`) that Playground uses
  to include the same source directory path that you just added to `angular-playground.json`. Note that since we are
  now using the `includes` property, we need to include all the source files for the main app as well. The changes to
  make are demonstrated below.

  If your library contains unit tests, you will need to exclude those (also shown below).

<div

</div>

  **That's all!** Run Playground and you should see sandboxes from both your app and your library.
