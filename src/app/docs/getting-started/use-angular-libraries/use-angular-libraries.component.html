<h1>Use Your Angular Libraries in Playground</h1>
<section markdown>
  Playground supports sandboxing your Angular Libraries in addition to your main Angular app, so you can easily
  work with all the sandboxed components in your Angular project. Once you have Playground set up with your main app,
  you will need to update just a few files in order to make it work with the sandboxes in your Angular Library.

  Let's say our project structure looks something like this:
  ```
  my-app
  ├── angular.json
  ├── angular-playground.json
  ├── package.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  ├── tsconfig.playground.json
  ├── ...
  ├── projects
  │   ├── my-lib
  │   │   ├── src
  │   │   │   └── ...
  │   │   └── ...
  ├── src
  │   ├── tsconfig.app.json
  │   ├── main.ts
  │   ├── main.playground.ts
  │   └── ...
  ```

  First, you'll need to update `angular-playground.json` to include the source directory of your library.

<div

  path="content/docs/getting-started/use-angular-libraries.md"
  lines="4">
</div>

  Then, in `tsconfig.playground.json`, you need to add to `"includes"` property the library's sandbox.ts files.
</section>
<div
  markdown
  path="content/docs/getting-started/use-angular-libraries3.md"
  lines="14">
</div>
<section markdown>
  **That's all!** Run Playground and you should see sandboxes from both your app and your library.
