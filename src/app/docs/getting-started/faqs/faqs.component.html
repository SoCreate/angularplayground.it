  <blockquote>
    Why does Playground redirect away from my component on reload?
  </blockquote>

  Playground itself does not do any routing. If you encounter this issue, it is likely due to the
  `RouterModule` being provided to your sandboxed component, leading it to perform routing as it
  would in your app. In order to prevent this, you need to instead provide the `RouterTestingModule`
  in your playground configuration.

  ##### Do this...

  `RouterTestingModule.withRoutes(YOUR_ROUTES)`

  ##### ...not this

  `RouterModule.forRoot(YOUR_ROUTES)`


  ##### On Push Change Detection

  Not currently supported on the 'playground-app'
