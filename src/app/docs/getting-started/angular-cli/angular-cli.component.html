<h1>Setup with Angular CLI</h1>
<blockquote>For Angular CLI <code>6.0.0</code> and above</blockquote>
<section markdown>
  Setting up an existing [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) application to use Playground requires a few steps:

  1. Create an entry point for Playground: `main.playground.ts`
  2. Add another project configuration object to `angular.json`
  3. Configure a new `angular-playground.json` file
  4. Add a scripts entry to `package.json`
</section>
<h4>Install Angular Playground</h4>
<section markdown>
  ```
  npm install --save-dev angular-playground
  ```
</section>
<h4>A New Main Entry File</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli2.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  You need to call `initializePlayground()` with the appropriate selector string
  for your `AppComponent` (internally, Playground will set up shop in your existing `index.html`).
</section>
<h4>Add a project to the Angular CLI Config</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli3.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  You will want to configure the following properties:

  - Add a new project configuration and name it ("playground" is a good name for that ðŸ˜Ž)
  - `outDir` A build directory (in case you want to build Playground)
  - `main` Point to the new entry script you created above


  The rest of the properties can be the same as your main project.
</section>
<h4>Add the Angular Playground Config</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  The above file needs to be added to the root of your application (at the same level as `package.json`).

  `sourceRoot` points at the source of your Angular application. In this example, we're using the
  [@angular/cli](https://cli.angular.io/), so the `sourceRoot` is `./src/`. Additionally, we need to 
  provide the name of our Angular application, as specified in our `angular.json`.
  
  If you'd like to configure @angular/cli to run a different port, or would like to take a look
  at the other options available for this configuration file, see the
  <a routerLink="/docs/api/configuration">API documentation</a>.
</section>
<h4>Add Playground to Package.json</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli7.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  Add the entry `"playground": "angular-playground"` to the scripts listing in your `package.json`. From here
  on out, running Playground is as easy as calling:

  ```
  npm run playground
  ```

  Navigate to `localhost:4201` (or your own port, as outlined above) and start sandboxing components!
