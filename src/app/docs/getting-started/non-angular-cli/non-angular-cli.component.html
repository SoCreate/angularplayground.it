<h1>Setup without Angular CLI</h1>
<section markdown>
  This guide assumes you already have Angular configured to work
  with Webpack.

  Setting up an existing application without Angular CLI requires a few steps:

  1. Create an entry point for Playground: `main.playground.ts`
  2. Provide configuration: `angular-playground.json`
  3. Configure a build script: `package.json`

<h4>Install Angular Playground</h4>
<section markdown>
  ```
  npm install --save-dev angular-playground
  ```
</section>
<h4>Create an Entry Point</h4>
<section markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/bootstrapping.md"></section>
<section markdown>
  Change the entry point of your webpack configuration to point at this file,
  `main.playground.ts`. The `selector` property passed into `configure()` should
  be the selector of your root component, `app.component.ts`.

  If you decide to set up a separate `index.html` file in your project for Playground
  simply leave the selector property off of the `.configure()` call.

<h4>Add the Angular Playground Config</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/non-angular-cli.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  The above configuration file is used to configure many different Playground options (including running
  tests, integration with @angular/cli, etc.). See the <a routerLink="/docs/api/configuration">API documentation</a>
  for more information.
</section>
<h4>Add Playground to package.json</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/non-angular-cli-package-json.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  To run Playground, you will need to serve your application with your build system of choice while
  running the Playground CLI. We recommend using [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently).

  Additionally, the `--no-serve` flag is needed to prevent the Playground CLI from running an Angular
  CLI `ng serve` behind the scenes.
