<h1>Installation</h1>
<blockquote>For use with Angular CLI</blockquote>
<section markdown>
  Setting up an existing [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) application to use Playground requires one simple step:

  1. run `ng add angular-playground`

  This will install the angular-playground package as well as set up the necessary config files for you to start developing with Playground!
  From here on out, running Playground is as easy as calling:

  ```
  npm run playground
  ```

  Navigate to `localhost:4201` and start sandboxing components!

  <h4>Overview of New/Modified Files</h4>
  <section markdown>
    Playground needs some new configuration files in order to work properly.
    Follow along to see what's been added!
  </section>
  <h4>A New Main Entry File</h4>
  <div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli2.md"></div>
  <section markdown>
    You need to pass in the appropriate selector string
    for your `AppComponent` (internally, Playground will set up shop in your existing `index.html`).
  </section>
  <h4>A New Project in the Angular CLI Config</h4>
  <div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli3.md"></div>
  <section markdown>
    You may want to configure the following properties:

    - `outputPath` A build directory (in case you want to build Playground)
    - `main` Points to the new `main.playground.ts` file

    The rest of the properties can be the same as your main project.
  </section>
  <h4>A Config File for Angular Playground</h4>
  <div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli.md"></div>
  <section markdown>
    `sourceRoots` points at the source of your Angular application (and component libraries, if you have any).
    In this example, we're using the [@angular/cli](https://cli.angular.io/), so `sourceRoots` is [`./src/`].
    Additionally, we need to use the name of our Angular application, as specified in our `angular.json`.

    If you'd like to configure @angular/cli to run on a different port, or would like to take a look
    at the other options available for this configuration file, see the
    <a routerLink="/docs/api/configuration">API documentation</a>.
  </section>
  <h4>A Typescript configuration file</h4>
  <div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli4.md"></div>
  <h4>A Playground Script in Package.json</h4>
  <div markdown path="content/docs/api/cli2.md"></div>
  <section markdown>
    An npm command to run playground has been added to the scripts listing in your `package.json`.
