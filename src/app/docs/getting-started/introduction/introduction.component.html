  The component architecture of [Angular](https://angular.io) allows for modularity, which can be glorious!
  You can break down your application into smaller chunks, encapsulate logic and data,
  and capitalize on re-usability. However, working on those chunks in the scope of your application
  can easily become cumbersome.

  Take, for example, a component that renders a shipment line item. To see that component in action
  requires you to launch your app, locate a customer with a proper order, ensure
  that order contains a shipment, and ensure that shipment contains line items.
  Now imagine needing to step through that whole workflow with every change to your component.
  Development of modular components would be much more efficient if you could work on
  them in isolation...

  ##### Welcome to Angular Playground!

  Playground is a drop-in module that provides a development environment for building
  and maintaining isolated Angular components, directives, and pipes. It uses your existing
  source code to bootstrap "scenarios" around components, allowing you the flexibility to develop
  and test components without the weight of your entire application.

    Leveraging your build pipeline, Playground runs like an instance of your app.

  The Playground CLI watches your filesystem so every time you change a component
  in your source code, affected scenarios are immediately updated. After creating a few scenarios,
  simply run `angular-playground` or `npm run playground` to start your build.
