<h1>The Playground CLI</h1>
<p markdown>
  Playground is designed to find files in your existing app with
  the `.sandbox.ts` extension that use the Playground API to set up sandboxes
  of components. To do this auto-discovery the Playground needs to
  create a static file on the fly (**sandboxes.ts**) to be able to have everything play nice with
  Angular's module system. To do that, Playground provides a cli!

  The cli for the playground can be run with the command:

```
angular-playground [config-file]
```

  So, you will need a config file! Create an **angular-playground.json** file in
  your project (typically next to your package.json file) with the following content:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  The `sourceRoot` value will be a path relative to the location of your **package.json**
  file for your project. This will be the directory that will be looked at (it will go down recursively from there)
  to find your **\*.sandbox.ts** files dynamically. It will also be the directory where the **sandboxes.ts**
  file will get written to.

  This means you will most likely want to add `sandboxes.ts` to your `.gitignore` file:

```
/src/sandboxes.ts
```

  You will also want to set up a script in your `package.json` file to handle running the
  cli command:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/cli2.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  From there you can call:

```
npm run playground
```

  This will build your `sandboxes.ts` file and will start a watch that will handle
  re-running the file build as you modify/add files with the `*.sandbox.ts` extension
  in your project.

  Next you need to serve up the Playground within your environment. Check out how you can:
