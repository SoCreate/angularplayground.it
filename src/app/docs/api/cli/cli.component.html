<h1>The Playground CLI</h1>
<p markdown>
  Playground is designed to find files in your existing app with
  the `.sandbox.ts` extension that use the Playground API to set up sandboxes
  of components. To do this, the Playground needs to
  create a static file on the fly (`sandboxes.ts`) to have everything play nicely with
  Angular's module system. Luckily we have a CLI that does this process for you: 

  #### angular-playground

  The `angular-playground` command has the following arguments/flags:  

  ```
  [config-file] - optional
      The path to the config file (including file name) relative to 
      the package.json file location. This is optional. The command
      will auto-look for a config file named angular-playground.json
      next to the package.json when this argument is left off.

  -no-watch
      Disables the watch call so only the sandboxes.ts file build is run.
      Useful for when you want to build Playground and serve it up somewhere.

  -no-serve
      Disables the Angular CLI integrated ng serve call.
      Useful for when you want to build Playground and serve it up somewhere.
  ```

  #### Running the CLI

  By default, the CLI will assume that its configuration file lives at the root of the project
  (where `package.json` is located) and is called `angular-playground.json`. If these conditions
  are met, you can run the CLI like so:

  ```
  angular-playground
  ```

  Otherwise, a configuration file must be specified:

  ```
  angular-playground ./src/playground-options.json 
  ```
</p>
<h4>Example Configuration File</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  The `sourceRoot` value will be a path relative to the location of your **package.json**
  file for your project. This will be the directory that will be looked at (it will go down recursively from there)
  to find your **\*.sandbox.ts** files dynamically. It will also be the directory where the **sandboxes.ts**
  file will get written to.

  This means you will most likely want to add `sandboxes.ts` to your `.gitignore` file:

```
/src/sandboxes.ts
```

  You will also want to set up a script in your `package.json` file to handle running the
  cli command:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/cli2.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  From there you can call:

```
npm run playground
```

  This will build your `sandboxes.ts` file and will start a watch that will handle
  re-running the file build as you modify/add files with the `*.sandbox.ts` extension
  in your project.
