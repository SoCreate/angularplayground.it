<h1>The Playground CLI</h1>
<div markdown>
  Playground ships with a CLI that sets up sandboxes for components at
  runtime. All developers need to do is define component sandboxes in
  files ending with the extension: `.sandbox.ts`. The CLI will take
  these "sandbox files" and compile them into a single file, `./src/sandboxes.ts`,
  which is used to bootstrap the Angular Playground application.

  #### angular-playground

  The `angular-playground` command has the following arguments/flags:  

  </div>
  <div markdown>

  ```
  --config
      (default: angular-playground.json)
      The path to the config file (including file name) relative to 
      the package.json file location.

  --no-watch
      Disables the watch call so only the sandboxes.ts file build is run.
      Useful for when you want to build Playground and serve it up somewhere.

  --no-serve
      Disables the Angular CLI integrated ng serve call.
      Useful for when you want to build Playground and serve it up somewhere.

  --check-errors
      Starts Angular Playground and checks all component scenarios for console
      errors. All erroring scenarios will be reported and the process will be
      killed, allowing this command to be run as a build step.

  --random-scenario
      Instead of running through all scenarios when checking for console
      errors, will run through all components, picking one random
      scenario for each. Useful if your system has many scenarios
      per component.

  #### Running the CLI

  By default, the CLI will assume that its configuration file lives at the root of the project
  (where `package.json` is located) and is called `angular-playground.json`. If these conditions
  are met, you can run the CLI like so:

  ```
  angular-playground
  ```

  Otherwise, a configuration file must be specified:

  ```
  angular-playground ./src/playground-options.json 
  ```
</div>
<h4>Example Configuration File</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/api/cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  The `sourceRoot` value will be a path relative to the location of your **package.json**
  file for your project. This will be the directory that will be looked at (it will go down recursively from there)
  to find your **\*.sandbox.ts** files dynamically. It will also be the directory where the **sandboxes.ts**
  file will get written to.

  This means you will most likely want to add `sandboxes.ts` to your `.gitignore` file:

```
/src/sandboxes.ts
```

  You will also want to set up a script in your `package.json` file to handle running the
  cli command:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/api/cli2.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  From there you can call:

```
npm run playground
```

  This will build your `sandboxes.ts` file and will start a watch that will handle
  re-running the file build as you modify/add files with the `*.sandbox.ts` extension
  in your project.
