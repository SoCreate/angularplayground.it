<h1>The Playground CLI</h1>
<p markdown>
  Playground is designed to find files in your existing app with
  the `.sandbox.ts` extension that use the Playground API to set up sandboxes
  of components. To do this auto-discovery the Playground needs to
  create a static file on the fly (**sandboxes.ts**) to be able to have everything play nice with
  Angular's module system. To do that, Playground provides a cli!

  The cli for the playground can be run with the command:

```
angular-playground [config-file]
```

  The `angular-playground` command will look for a file named `angular-playground.json` 
  next to your `package.json` file by default. The `config-file` argument is optional
  and provides a way for you to point to the config file if you want to put it in a different
  location or name it something else.

  So, you will need a config file! Create an **angular-playground.json** file in
  your project (typically next to your package.json file) with the following content:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  The `sourceRoot` value will be a path relative to the location of your **package.json**
  file for your project. This will be the directory that will be looked at (it will go down recursively from there)
  to find your **\*.sandbox.ts** files dynamically. It will also be the directory where the **sandboxes.ts**
  file will get written to.

  This means you will most likely want to add `sandboxes.ts` to your `.gitignore` file:

```
/src/sandboxes.ts
```

  You will also want to set up a script in your `package.json` file to handle running the
  cli command:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/cli2.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  From there you can call:

```
npm run playground
```

  This will build your `sandboxes.ts` file and will start a watch that will handle
  re-running the file build as you modify/add files with the `*.sandbox.ts` extension
  in your project.

  #### The angular-playground command

  The `angular-playground` command has the following arguments/flags:  

```
[config-file]
    The path to the config file (including file name) relative to 
    the package.json file location. This is optional. The command
    will auto-look for a config file named angular-playground.json
    next to the package.json when this argument is left off.

-no-watch
    Disables the watch call so only the sandboxes.ts file build is run.
    Useful for when you want to build Playground and serve it up somewhere.

-no-serve
    Disables the Angular CLI integrated ng serve call.
    Useful for when you want to build Playground and serve it up somewhere.
```

  Next you need to serve up the Playground within your environment. Check out how you can:
