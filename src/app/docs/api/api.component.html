<h1>Sandbox API</h1>
<section markdown>
  All of the sandbox API functions/classes/interfaces are exported from the `angular-playground`
  module. If you are using TypeScript you can do an import statement to get access to them.

  The `sandboxOf` function and `SandboxBuilder` are *"TypeScripted"* out so you can discover
  the different parameters/options/etc within your IDE/editor (if it has TypeScript support).
  Or you can always explore the [source code](https://github.com/socreate/angular-playground)!

  The `sandboxOf` function returns an instance of a `SandboxBuilder` that has a fluent
  api allowing for method chaining via it's `add` method. The `add` method is used to add
  scenarios for your sandboxed component. Each scenario needs a `description` (the first parameter),
  and a `scenarioConfig` object (the second parameter). The `scenarioConfig` object requires a
  `template` property at a minimum.

  The `SandboxOfConfig` gives you a way to set dependencies for the sandboxed component. This creates
  a dynamic `NgModule` around the sandboxed component. So these config properties are the same ones you
  are used to using for an `NgModule` decorator. This also has a `prependText` property that allows you to
  put text in front of the component type name that gets rendered in the Angular Playground UI. So if you
  have 2 components in your app named `InfoBlock` that lived in different features, you could use the `prependText`
  to make those unique for readability in the UI (something like `prependText: 'featureA.'` and `prependText: 'featureB.'`).

  The `ScenarioConfig` gives you a way to set dependencies at the component level. These are used as the
  `Component` decorator metadata for a host component that renders your sandboxed component as well as the
  host component context (i.e. - any type of class properties on the host component that you want to be able
  to feed to your sandboxed component). So these config properties are the same ones you are used to using for
  a parent component.
