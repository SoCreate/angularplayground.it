<h1>Reporter Formats</h1>
<section markdown>
Playground currently supports two report formats:

1. `log`: Console log, no report file published
2. `json`: JSON output, defaults output file to `./sandbox.report.json`

Specify a type with the `reportType` configuration flag.

```
angular-playground --check-errors --report-type json
```

Below is an example output file provided by the `JSONReporter`. It is based on mocha's JSON
format, so you should be able to integrate it into your build process with the same parser.
