<h1>Configuration</h1>
<section markdown>
  Playground supports several configuration options that allow you to provide modules
  to all of your sandboxes or opt-in to different UI features within the
  application itself.

  Configuration is provided through the `.configure()` method of the
  `PlaygroundModule`. For example, the following configuration provides the
  `BrowserAnimationsModule` to all sandboxes:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/how-to/configuration-plugins/all-options.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  #### <a name="overlay"></a>Overlay

  For devices without keyboard access, enable Playground's overlay to control
  the command bar:

  ```typescript
PlaygroundModule
  .configure({{ '{' }}
    selector: 'app-root',
    // Enable overlay for toggling command bar
    overlay: true
  {{ '}' }});
  ```

  #### <a name="modules"></a>Modules

  The `PlaygroundModule` is used as the root `NgModule` for the Playground application. Therefore,
  user-specific modules that need to be provided at the root level, like `BrowserAnimationsModule`,
  need to attach themselves to the `PlaygroundModule` in order to be registered for the application.
  We can achieve this with the `modules` property.

  ```typescript
PlaygroundModule
  .configure({{ '{' }}
    selector: 'app-root',
    // Provide modules to all sandboxes in your application
    modules: [
      BrowserAnimationsModule,
      // Register service workers for production builds
      environment.production
        ? ServiceWorkerModule.register('/ngsw-worker.js')
        : []
    ],
    sandboxesDefined: SandboxesDefined
  {{ '}' }});
  ```

  In the above snippet, `BrowserAnimationsModule` and `ServiceWorkerModule` are added to the
  root Playground application module, allowing them to work as intended.

  <blockquote>
    Note: modules added at this level will be available globally, accessible from all sandboxes.

  #### <a name="custom-html"></a>Custom HTML Page

  If you'd like to run Playground in a custom HTML page (other than the one you're serving your
  regular app on), do the following.

  1. Omit the `selector` property in configuration
  2. Add the &lt;ap-root&gt;&lt;/ap-root&gt; element to your custom HTML page (e.g. `index.playground.html`)


  This will allow Playground to bootstrap itself onto the HTML page. Here's an example:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/how-to/configuration-plugins/custom-html.md"></div>
<section markdown>
</section>
