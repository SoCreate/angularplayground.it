<h1>Setup with Angular CLI</h1>
<blockquote>For Angular CLI <code>1.5.0</code> and above</blockquote>
<section markdown>
  Setting up an existing [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) application to use Playground requires a few steps:

  1. Create an entry point for Playground: `main.playground.ts`
  2. Add another app configuration object to `.angular-cli.json`
  3. Configure a new `angular-playground.json` file
  4. Update tsconfig compiler options (`tsconfig.app.json`)
  5. Add a scripts entry to `package.json`

<h4>Install Angular Playground</h4>
<section markdown>
  ```
  npm install --save-dev angular-playground
  ```
</section>
<h4>A New Main Entry File</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli2.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  You need to call `initializePlayground()` with the appropriate selector string
  for your `AppComponent` (internally, Playground will set up shop in your existing `index.html`).
</section>
<h4>Add an App to the Angular CLI Config</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli3.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  You will want to configure the following properties:

  - `name` The name of your Playground app ("playground" is a good name for that ðŸ˜Ž)
  - `outDir` A build directory (in case you want to build Playground)
  - `main` Point to the new entry script you created above


  The rest of the properties can be the same as your main app.
</section>
<h4>Update the Angular Playground Config</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  The `angularCli` property tells our `angular-playground` CLI to use `ng serve` as its build tool. We
  offer a few extra properties within `angularCli` to configure your application:

  + `appName`
  The name of the app from the `.angular-cli.json` config file.
  ```
  e.g. "appName": "playground"
  ```

  + `port` *(optional)*
  The port specified for `ng serve`. Defaults to `4201`.
  ```
  e.g. "port": 8000
  ```

  + `environment` *(optional)*
  The targeted environment Playground will serve (overrides Angular CLI's default).
  ```
  e.g. "environment": "environments/environment.prod.ts"
  ```

  + `args` *(optional)*
  An array of strings that will get passed through as options to the `ng serve` command. This is useful
  if you want to pass things like `-o` to tell the Angular CLI to auto open the serve in a browser.
  ```
  e.g. "args": [ "--ssl" ]
  ```

<h4 id="compiler-options">Update tsconfig Compiler Options</h4>
<section markdown>
  Change the `compilerOptions.module` option in your `tsconfig.app.json` to <em>"esnext"</em>.
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli5.md"></div>
<h4>Add Playground to Package.json</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli7.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  Add the entry `"playground": "angular-playground"` to the scripts listing in your `package.json`. From here
  on out, running Playground is as easy as calling:

  ```
  npm run playground
  ```

  Navigate to `localhost:4201` (or your own port, as outlined above) and start sandboxing components!
