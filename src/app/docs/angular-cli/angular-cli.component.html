<h1>Setting up an Angular CLI Powered Project</h1>

<blockquote>For Angular CLI <code>1.0.0</code> and above</blockquote>

<section markdown>
  Playground ‚ù§Ô∏è's Angular CLI and has built in support for integrating with it.
  If your app is using the **Angular CLI** you can set up a new app in Angular CLI
  to run Playground from it. The most minimal setup involves the following four steps:

  1. Create a new main entry script.
  2. Add an app entry to the `.angular-cli.json` file.
  3. Configure the `angular-playground.json` file.
  4. Update tsconfig Compiler Options

<h4>A new main entry file</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli2.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  You need to call `initializePlayground()` and pass it in the selector string
  for your `AppComponent` (you will be making use of your existing `index.html` file).

  And you want to bootstrap the `PlaygroundModule`.
</section>
<h4>Add an app to the Angular CLI config</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli3.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  The following properties are the ones you will want to configure for Playground:

  - `name` The name of your Playground app ("playground" is a good name for that üòé)
  - `outDir` A build dir (in case you want to build Playground)
  - `main` Point to the new entry script you created above


  The rest of the properties can be the same as your main app.
</section>
<h4>Update the Angular Playground config</h4>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  When the `angularCli` property is present the `ng serve` command will be used when you
  run the `angular-playground` cli command. Below is a description of the properties of that
  object:

  + `appName`
  The name of the app from the `.angular-cli.json` config file.

  + `port` *(optional)*
  The port to tell `ng serve` to use. Defaults to `4201`.

  + `envionment` *(optional)*
  The environment to target for serving up Playground (will tell Angular CLI to use this instead of its default)

  + `args` *(optional)*
  An array of strings that will get passed through as options to the `ng serve` command. Useful
  if you want to pass things like `-o` to tell the Angular CLI to auto open the serve in a browser.
</p>
<h4>Update tsconfig Compiler Options</h4>
<p markdown>
  Change the compilerOptions -> module option in your `tsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.app.json` to be set to <em>"esnext"</em>.

  The Playground CLI will handle running the sandbox file build and watch and
  will also kick off `ng serve` and target your environment configured for the playground.

  With the setup in place it's time to <a routerLink="/docs/sandboxing/sandboxing-components">start sandboxing</a>
