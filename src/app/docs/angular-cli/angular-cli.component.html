<h1>Setting up an Angular CLI Powered Project</h1>

<p markdown>
  Playground ❤️'s Angular CLI and has built in support for integrating with it.
  If your app is using the **Angular CLI** you can set up your **angular-playground.json**
  file to have Playground make use of its `ng serve` under the hood.
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  When the `angularCli` property is present the `ng serve` command will be used when you
  run the `angular-playground` cli command. Below is a description of the properties of that
  object:

  + `envionment` *(optional)*
  The environment to target for serving up Playground (will tell Angular CLI to use this instead of its default)

  + `port` *(optional)*
  The port to tell `ng serve` to use. Defaults to `4201`.

  You will most likely want to create a new environment file
  (see the [angular cli docs on GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#build-targets-and-environment-files))
  for the playground and make some changes to your existing `main.ts` file
  and your existing environment files.

  Starting with the new environment file for playground:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli2.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  Here the code is exporting the `PlaygroundModule` as the type `AppModule`. This is going
  to allow you to keep your `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)` call
  in your `main.ts` the same. You need to do this because **AngularCLI** only
  supports one entry script in the project. So you need a way to dynamically
  tell that script to bootstrap either your host app module or the playground module.

  Then you need to call `initializePlayground()` and pass it in the selector string
  for your `AppComponent`.

  You will also need to update your existing `environment.*.ts` files to export
  your `AppModule`. You should be able to do this by simply adding a line similar to:
</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli3.md"></div>
<p>Ok, then over in the entry point script:</p>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/angular-cli4.md"></div>
<p markdown>
  You need to change the `AppModule` import to come from `./environments/environment`
  instead of the typical `./app/app.module` and that's it!

  With that, you have added support to the single `main.ts` file to bootstrap
  different modules based on environment used.

  The Playground CLI will handle running the sandbox file build and watch and
  will also kick off `ng serve` and target your environment configured for the playground.
