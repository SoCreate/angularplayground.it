<h1>Installing</h1>
<p>
  Angular Playground is available as an npm package.
</p>
<section markdown>
```
npm i -D angular-playground
```
</section>
<p>
  There are three primary steps to getting up and running with Angular Playground.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Install the package into your project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a <a routerLink="/docs/getting-started/cli">json config file</a> for
    the Angular Playground CLI to use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up <a routerLink="/docs/getting-started/bootstrapping">bootstrap logic</a>
    to make use of the `PlaygroundModule` as an entry module.
  </li>
</ol>
<section markdown>
  From there you can start writing sandbox files for your components and directives
  and make use of the Angular Playground CLI to discover those files and watch for changes.
  With all that in place, you just need to serve up the bootstrap logic that uses
  the `PlaygroundModule`.
