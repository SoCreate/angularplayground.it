<h1>Installing</h1>
<p>
  Angular Playground is available as an npm package.
</p>
<section markdown>
```
npm install --save-dev angular-playground
```

<p>
  There are three primary steps to getting up and running with Angular Playground:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Install the package into your project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a <a routerLink="/docs/api/cli">json config file</a> for
    the Playground CLI to use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up <a routerLink="/docs/getting-started/bootstrapping">bootstrap logic</a>
    to make use of the `PlaygroundModule` as an entry module.
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Using the Angular CLI? Jump right into <a routerLink="/docs/getting-started/angular-cli">getting started</a>.</blockquote>
<section markdown>
  From there you can start writing sandbox files for your components and directives
  and make use of the Playground CLI to discover those files and watch for changes.
  With all that in place, you just need to serve up the bootstrap logic that uses
  the `PlaygroundModule`.
